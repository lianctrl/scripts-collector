# scripts-collector
Just a collection of scripts written during these academic years

## Organization
This main folder contains other different folder named based on the language of the scripts inside them

## Purpose
This is just a **mere collection** of script to show my works, it is not assured that some scripts can be compiled (for **C/C++** and **F90**) or executed (**python** and **bash**) 
due to the fact that some libraries or modules are **missing** or files on which they operate are not in there

## Remarks
Thanks to **GitHub** to host my scripts as an example of my works and the help in develop codes during those years.
